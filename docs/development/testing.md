# Testing and Verification

## Canonical gate

```powershell
./scripts/verify.ps1
```

The gate performs, in order:

1. prerequisite validation and locked restore;
2. formatting verification;
3. Release solution build;
4. Core and GPU-independent Client tests without rebuilding;
5. a 200-agent, 10,000-tick, seed-1 headless determinism workload.

It does not launch a window or alter authoritative game state. It never runs a
destructive Git or filesystem cleanup.

This repository intentionally uses local-only verification. There is no GitHub
Actions workflow or hosted-CI completion gate. Run the canonical gate on the
integration workstation and record its exact result.

## Focused commands

```powershell
./scripts/test.ps1 -Configuration Release
dotnet test tests/Hukbo.Client.Tests/Hukbo.Client.Tests.csproj -c Release
dotnet test tests/Hukbo.Core.Tests -c Release `
  --filter FullyQualifiedName~DeterminismTests
./scripts/benchmark.ps1 -Agents 200 -Ticks 10000 -Seed 1
./scripts/format.ps1 -Verify
```

Client presentation tests must not create an `ArenaGame`, graphics device,
sprite batch, or window. Tests must remain independent from GPU, audio
hardware, window focus, network, wall clock, `System.Random`, and platform input
types. Performance output is evidence, not a universal frame-time guarantee.

## Latest non-interactive result

The sound-variant run on 2026-07-27 recorded `./scripts/verify.ps1 -SkipBootstrap`
passing every stage:

- 505/505 Client tests passed;
- 156/156 Core tests passed;
- formatting verification and the Release build passed with 0 warnings and
  0 errors;
- the seed-1 200-agent workload ended in `Faction1Victory` at tick 235 with
  state hash `6EBB1EA63114F6CE` and event hash `941377BD43C556FF`, reporting
  `deterministic: true` and `firstMismatchTick: null`;
- that workload allocated 15,122,504 bytes.

Both hashes are **unchanged** from the baseline recorded below, which is the
expected result: hit-location sound variants live entirely in `Hukbo.Client` and
touch no Core code, so any movement would have been a bug in that change rather
than a new oracle.

Interactive variant playback is unverified. Rows 18 to 21 below are `PENDING`;
compiling the client and listing the files on disk does not establish that a
single sound was ever heard.

### The earlier post-integration result

The post-integration local run on 2026-07-27 recorded:

- 189/189 Client presentation and round-lifecycle tests passed;
- 141/141 Core tests passed;
- `./scripts/verify.ps1 -SkipBootstrap` passed formatting and the Release build
  with 0 warnings and 0 errors;
- the seed-1 200-agent workload ended in `Faction1Victory` at tick 235 with
  state hash `6EBB1EA63114F6CE` and event hash `941377BD43C556FF`;
- the same workload allocated 15,128,696 bytes, below the captured
  19,856,712-byte baseline;
- the seed-distribution guard for seeds 1 through 20 produced victories for
  both factions rather than a single always-winning faction;
- the 500-agent stress workload remained deterministic and ended at tick 309;
- the earlier spectator-clarity package run produced
  `artifacts/packages/client-win-x64/Hukbo.Client.exe`;
- that packaged Client opened visibly, remained responsive, showed
  `Hukbo — A 0 : 0 B — Seed 1 — Tick 0 — 1x — Paused — Ongoing`, and returned exit code 0
  after a normal window-close request;
- the earlier spectator-clarity independent review reported no Critical, High,
  Medium, or Low findings.

Both hashes moved from the previously recorded `210C5EF8E7BE4D48` and
`CE35EDA4B2A4E5A4`. That movement is expected rather than a regression: the
Philippine combat configuration put each agent's loadout into the state hash and
each attack's weapon and hit location into the event hash. The values above are
the new oracle. The outcome (`Faction1Victory` at tick 235) and the 500-agent
stress result (tick 309) are unchanged across that transition, which is what
tells us the change was additive rather than behavioural.

Allocation for the same workload rose from 12,108,304 bytes, a 24.9% increase
caused by the two nullable enum fields added to `BattleEvent`. That is past the
ten-percent reporting threshold in `SIMULATION-GAME-STANDARDS.md` §8, so it is
reported rather than absorbed: see
[docs/plans/2026-07-27-battle-event-allocation-packing.md](../plans/2026-07-27-battle-event-allocation-packing.md)
for the measurement and the conditions for paying it down. Run-to-run variation
in this figure is roughly a few thousand bytes; treat a change of that size as
noise and anything larger as worth investigating.

These results prove the non-interactive gate only. They do not change any
hands-on control, selection, event-log, scoring, or reset row below.

### 2026-07-27 plains-backdrop gate run

A second local run on 2026-07-27, recorded after the plains battlefield
backdrop change, showed:

- `./scripts/format.ps1 -Verify` passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors;
- `./scripts/verify.ps1 -SkipBootstrap` passed all five stages;
- 141/141 Core tests passed;
- 223/223 Client tests passed, up from the 189 recorded above because of the 34
  new plains backdrop geometry test cases across 14 test methods;
- the seed-1, 200-agent, 10,000-tick headless workload ended in
  `Faction1Victory` at tick 235 with state hash `6EBB1EA63114F6CE` and event
  hash `941377BD43C556FF`, and the run reported `deterministic: true`;
- the same workload allocated 15,122,504 bytes, slightly below the previously
  recorded 15,128,696-byte baseline.

Both the state hash and the event hash are unchanged from the values recorded
above. That is the expected result for a presentation-only change: the plains
backdrop touches only `Hukbo.Client` rendering, `Hukbo.Core` was not modified,
and neither hash moving confirms the backdrop did not leak into the
deterministic simulation.

### 2026-07-27 plains-backdrop review-fix partial re-run

Code review of the change above produced two high-severity findings, both fixed:
a duplicated ground-cell formula that left the shipped render loop uncovered
while the tests constrained a method with no production caller, and incorrect
test counts in the entry above. Four medium findings were also fixed: decal
shades are now bounded by a named ceiling so the high-contrast theme does not
receive mid-grey speckle on pure black, decals are clipped to the map rectangle
so they cannot bleed past the arena border, the shade-count and decal-kind
couplings are now asserted by tests, and the renderer's positional parameter
lists are grouped into a `PlainsBackdropFrame` value.

The canonical gate could **not** be re-run in full after these fixes, and this
is recorded as a limitation rather than a pass. At the time of the re-run the
working tree also carried in-flight, unrelated work for a sound system, a
blood-and-gore layer, and army-composition settings, and several of those
untracked test files did not compile:

```
SoundCueMapperTests.cs(14,17): error CS0051: Inconsistent accessibility:
parameter type 'GameSoundId' is less accessible than method
'SoundCueMapperTests.Map_ReturnsTheWeaponSlotForAnAttack(WeaponId, GameSoundId)'
```

That failure belongs to the sound workstream, not to the backdrop. What was
verified after the review fixes:

- `./scripts/format.ps1 -Verify` passed, 0 of 148 files reformatted;
- the `Hukbo.Client` Release build succeeded with 0 warnings and 0 errors;
- all 42 plains backdrop test cases passed;
- 284/284 Client tests passed with the five non-compiling sound test files
  temporarily set aside and then restored;
- 145/145 Core tests passed.

The Core and Client totals above are higher than the 141 and 223 recorded for
the earlier run because the concurrent sound and gore workstreams have added
their own tests. Those totals are therefore not attributable to the backdrop
change alone and should not be cited as its baseline.

The headless determinism stage was not re-run after the review fixes. Every fix
is confined to `Hukbo.Client` presentation code, so no hash movement is
possible, but that remains an argument rather than recorded evidence. The full
`./scripts/verify.ps1` must be re-run once the sound workstream's test files
compile, and its output recorded here before this change is integrated.

### 2026-07-27 sound-system gate run

`./scripts/verify.ps1 -SkipBootstrap` on 2026-07-27, after the sound system
change, ended with `[PASS] Canonical repository verification completed` and
showed:

- `./scripts/format.ps1 -Verify` passed: `Formatted 0 of 150 files`;
- the Release build produced 0 warnings and 0 errors;
- 156/156 Core tests passed;
- 373/373 Client tests passed, including the 8 new sound suites — catalog,
  library, mapper, budget, cue log, director, cue formatter, and panel layout —
  plus the right-column split;
- the seed-1, 200-agent, 10,000-tick headless workload reported state hash
  `6EBB1EA63114F6CE`, event hash `941377BD43C556FF`, and
  `deterministic: true`.

Both hashes are unchanged from the values recorded above. That is the expected
result for a presentation-only change: the audio path lives entirely in
`Hukbo.Client`, reads the existing `BattleEvent` stream, and adds no Core type,
no Core file, and no simulation state.

An earlier attempt at this gate on the same day failed in the Core test stage,
and then failed to compile `Hukbo.Core` at all, because the working tree
simultaneously held an unfinished army-composition change to `Hukbo.Core`. That
failure was in Core, not in the sound system, and it cleared once the Core change
compiled again. Neither hash moved across either attempt.

### 2026-07-27 blood-and-gore gate run

`./scripts/verify.ps1 -SkipBootstrap` was run at the repository root on
2026-07-27 after the blood-and-gore feature was completed. It ended with
`[PASS] Canonical repository verification completed.` and printed:

```
[PASS] Formatting verification completed.
[PASS] Release solution build completed.
[PASS] Release repository tests completed.
[PASS] Headless workload completed: agents=200 ticks=10000 seed=1.
[PASS] Canonical repository verification completed.

Test Run Successful.
Total tests: 429
     Passed: 429
 Total time: 0.5805 Seconds
```

The headless determinism workload emitted this `RunReport`:

```json
{
  "environment": {
    "operatingSystem": "Microsoft Windows 10.0.26200",
    "framework": ".NET 10.0.10",
    "processArchitecture": "X64",
    "processorCount": 20
  },
  "seed": 1,
  "agentCount": 200,
  "requestedTicks": 10000,
  "measuredTicks": 235,
  "durationMilliseconds": 28.14780000000001,
  "tickPercentiles": {
    "p50Milliseconds": 0.0856,
    "p95Milliseconds": 0.1655,

  "stateHash": "6EBB1EA63114F6CE",
  "deterministic": true,
  "firstMismatchTick": null
}
```

Both the state hash (`6EBB1EA63114F6CE`) and the event hash
(`941377BD43C556FF`) are unchanged from the values recorded above, the run
reported `deterministic: true` with no first mismatch tick, and the outcome is
still `Faction1Victory` at tick 235 with 0 and 30 survivors. That is the
expected result for a presentation-only change: the blood layer lives entirely
in `Hukbo.Client`, reads the existing `BattleEvent` stream, and adds no
`Hukbo.Core` type, file, or simulation state. Neither hash moving is what
confirms `Hukbo.Core` was not modified.

Allocation for the same workload was 15,122,504 bytes, matching the figure
recorded for the plains-backdrop run above.

The reported test-run summary was `Total tests: 429` with all 429 passing. That
figure covers the whole repository test run at the time of this gate, and the
working tree also carried tests belonging to concurrent workstreams, so it is
not attributable to the blood-and-gore feature alone and should not be cited as
its baseline.

These results prove the non-interactive gate only. The blood-and-gore smoke rows
below remain `PENDING` a human at an interactive Windows desktop.

## Interactive smoke checklist

Run `./scripts/run.ps1` on an interactive Windows desktop. This repository uses
local-only verification: there is no hosted-CI substitute for this direct
interaction pass. Compilation, automated tests, a window-opening probe, or
synthetic input do not make a manual row pass.

### Spectator clarity smoke

Record the observed value in `Actual` and change `Status` only after performing
the interaction. Use `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `BLOCKED`; leave untouched rows
`PENDING`.

| Evidence field | Recorded value |
| --- | --- |
| Date | Not recorded |
| Machine/platform | Not recorded |
| Source commit | Not recorded |
| Launch path (`source` or package path) | Not recorded |
| Optional screenshot paths | None recorded |

| Check | Expected observation | Actual | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Launch the game | The window opens, agents render, and the match starts paused with tick unchanged. | Not run | PENDING |
| 2. Activate Play | The always-visible Play button advances ticks; Space provides the same toggle while the modal is closed. | Not run | PENDING |
| 3. Activate Pause | The always-visible Pause button stops tick advancement and visibly indicates the paused state. | Not run | PENDING |
| 4. Open Menu | The always-visible Menu button pauses the match and opens the modal; Escape toggles that same menu behavior. | Not run | PENDING |
| 5. Exercise modal commands | Modal Play resumes and closes; modal Pause remains open and paused; Escape closes without resuming; Exit Game, which is available only in the modal, requests one clean shutdown. | Not run | PENDING |
| 6. Select an agent | A primary click on a living agent pins the inspector with ID, faction, alive/dead state, health, intent, target, and position. | Not run | PENDING |
| 7. Move away and observe death | Moving the pointer away does not clear selection; if the selected agent dies, the inspector remains pinned and shows its final `DEAD` state. | Not run | PENDING |
| 8. Check observational behavior | Selecting or inspecting an agent does not alter tick progression or the deterministic battle result; an empty-arena click clears selection and UI clicks do not click through. | Not run | PENDING |
| 9. Exercise event-log scrolling | At 1x and 4x, events remain ordered without duplicates and retain at most 200 rows. The wheel scrolls only the log while the pointer is over it and does not zoom the arena; new events do not steal an upward scroll position; returning to the bottom reveals the newest events; over the arena, the wheel zooms. | Not run | PENDING |
| 10. Reach a terminal outcome | The match pauses and the summary winner, both survivor counts, terminal tick, simulated duration, and seed match the final status and visible arena state; the summary offers Next Round. | Not run | PENDING |
| 11. Check score timing and team mapping | Team A is Blue/faction 0 and Team B is Red/faction 1. Reaching a victory does not change the score immediately; choosing Next Round adds exactly one win to that completed round's winner. Starting the next round after a draw or while the current round is ongoing adds no win. | Not run | PENDING |
| 12. Exercise ordinary Next Round | `R`, modal Next Round, and summary Next Round each preserve the score, speed, and camera; clear selection, event history, scroll state, and summary; and leave the fresh round paused. | Not run | PENDING |
| 13. Check seed progression | Each Next Round changes the seed to a distinct deterministic value. After Full Reset, repeating the same Next Round sequence produces the same seed sequence. | Not run | PENDING |
| 14. Exercise Full Reset | After changing the score, speed, and camera, press `Shift+R`; both win totals become 0, seed returns to 1, speed returns to 1x, the camera fits the arena, disposable UI state clears, and the fresh round is paused. Change state again and confirm modal Full Reset has the same result. | Not run | PENDING |
| 15. Close the window | The operating-system close button exits the process once with exit code 0. | Not run | PENDING |
| 16. Check the plains backdrop ground | The battle floor shows varied ground shading with scattered grass, dirt, and stone marks rather than one flat color. | Not run | PENDING |
| 17. Check backdrop stability at zoom extremes | Zooming fully out and fully in keeps the ground pattern locked to the same patches of map; the pattern does not crawl or shimmer, and decals neither vanish into flicker nor balloon into large blobs. | Not run | PENDING |
| 18. Check backdrop continuity while panning | Panning the camera across the map shows no seam lines, gaps, or overlapping bright edges between ground cells. | Not run | PENDING |
| 19. Check readability over the backdrop | Pawn silhouettes, faction ground rings, selection marks, and hit effects all remain clearly readable against the new backdrop. | Not run | PENDING |
| 20. Cycle every theme against the backdrop | Each theme produces a backdrop in its own palette, with the arena border still distinguishable from the ground. | Not run | PENDING |
| 21. Check backdrop reseeding on Next Round and Full Reset | Pressing `R` for a new round changes the backdrop with the new seed; pressing `Shift+R` for a full reset returns the seed-1 backdrop identical to the first launch. | Not run | PENDING |
| 22. Confirm the sound log is hidden by default | On launch, no sound panel is visible and the battle event log occupies the full height of the right column exactly as before. | Not run | PENDING |
| 23. Toggle the sound log | The `Sounds` control-bar button and `F9` both open and close the sound panel; the button shows an active state while it is open; the right column splits with battle events above and the sound log below, and nothing else on screen moves. | Not run | PENDING |
| 24. Check the expected-file list with an empty audio folder | With no files in `Content/Audio/`, the panel lists all nine expected file names, each marked `MISSING`, shows `MISSING 9/9`, and the game stays silent without errors. | Not run | PENDING |
| 25. Add one sound file | Drop a PCM WAV named `death.wav` into `Content/Audio/`, relaunch, and confirm that slot reads `READY`, the counter drops to `MISSING 8/9`, and a death audibly plays with a `PLAYED` row in the cue log. | Not run | PENDING |
| 26. Check an unusable file | Replace `death.wav` with a non-PCM file of the same name, relaunch, and confirm the slot reads `FAILED` rather than `MISSING`, and the game still runs silently for that slot. | Not run | PENDING |
| 27. Exercise mute and rate limiting | With files present, the panel's `MUTE` toggle silences playback while still logging rows; during a busy tick the cue log shows collapsed `LIMITED xN` rows rather than one row per suppressed cue. | Not run | PENDING |
| 28. Exercise sound-log scrolling and isolation | The wheel scrolls only the panel under the pointer — sound log, battle log, or arena zoom — and clicks inside the sound panel do not click through to the arena or clear the agent selection. | Not run | PENDING |
| 29. Check sound-log reset behavior | `R` and `Shift+R` clear the cue log while leaving the expected-file list and its statuses unchanged. | Not run | PENDING |
| 30. Open the Army Composition panel | Menu opens and the Army Composition button (between Next Round and Full Reset) shows the currently saved units-per-team and category counts in four steppers. | Not run | PENDING |
| 31. Adjust a category count | Left and Right arrows on a stepper adjust its value; Shift+Left and Shift+Right adjust by 10 instead of 1. The Unassigned readout updates live. | Not run | PENDING |
| 32. Check Unassigned reaches zero | Adjusting steppers such that category sum equals units-per-team displays Unassigned: 0. | Not run | PENDING |
| 33. Verify Apply gate behavior | Apply is disabled (ActionDisabled style, dimmed glyph) while Unassigned != 0 and while the draft equals the saved composition; Apply is enabled exactly when balanced and changed. | Not run | PENDING |
| 34. Check the staged banner | After pressing Apply, the panel closes, the menu shows a one-line notice stating the composition takes effect on the next Full Reset, and Apply remains disabled until a different composition is drafted and applied. | Not run | PENDING |
| 35. Verify Full Reset fields the chosen army | After applying a composition and pressing Full Reset (or `Shift+R`), the arena resets and both factions field the number and distribution of warriors specified by the staged composition, visible in the agent inspector and event log. | Not run | PENDING |
| 36. Observe blood at the default fit view | On first launch, with the default gore setting (Stylized) and the default camera fit, a landed blow shows a directional spray and a ground mark that are both plainly visible without zooming the camera in at all. | Not run | PENDING |
| 37. Check spray direction | Select an agent, watch it get struck, and confirm the spray leaves the victim along the line running from the attacker to the victim — pointing away from the attacker, never back toward it. Confirm this holds for blows arriving from several different directions. | Not run | PENDING |
| 38. Distinguish a lethal blow from a wound | A blow that kills its victim renders visibly differently from a blow that only wounds: the lethal tier is denser or longer-lived, and only the lethal blow leaves the ground mark described in row 39. A spectator can tell the two apart without reading the event log. | Not run | PENDING |
| 39. Check ground-mark persistence and fade | A ground mark stays on the battlefield after the fighters involved have moved away, then fades out gradually over time rather than vanishing in a single frame. Marks accumulate where the fighting was heaviest instead of spreading evenly. | Not run | PENDING |
| 40. Confirm gore Off draws nothing | With the gore setting on Off, no spray, spurt, or ground mark appears anywhere for any blow, including kills, at any camera zoom. The existing warm-white hit-effect ring still draws, so impacts remain readable. | Not run | PENDING |
| 41. Change gore intensity via the menu | Open Menu; the Gore Intensity control cycles Off, Stylized, Full and wraps at both ends using Left and Right and the pointer arrows. Each choice visibly changes blow rendering: Off shows nothing, Stylized shows spray and a fading mark, and Full additionally shows a sustained spurt on a kill together with denser, longer-lived marks. The change takes effect immediately, without a restart. | Not run | PENDING |
| 42. Reach the gore selector by keyboard | Inside the menu, `Tab`, `Down`, and `S` move focus from the theme selector through every button and land on the Gore Intensity selector as the final control in the order; continuing past it wraps back to the theme selector. `Up` and `W` reach it from the theme selector by wrapping backwards. While it is focused, Left and Right change the value and no button is activated. | Not run | PENDING |
| 43. Reach the gore selector by pointer | Hovering the Gore Intensity selector highlights it without changing the value; clicking its previous and next arrows changes the value; and a click on the selector does not click through to the arena or activate any menu button. | Not run | PENDING |
| 44. Check gore intensity persists across a restart | Set gore to Full, fully close the game, and relaunch it: Full is active from the first blow, without reopening the menu. Repeat with Off and confirm the same. | Not run | PENDING |
| 45. Check blood clears on Next Round and Full Reset | With sprays and ground marks visible on screen, trigger Next Round (`R`, modal, or summary); all blood clears immediately alongside the event log, inspector, and summary. Repeat separately with Full Reset (`Shift+R` and the modal command) and confirm the same. | Not run | PENDING |
| 46. Check blood readability across every theme | Cycle all five visual themes while blood is on screen. In every theme, including `high-contrast`, blood stays clearly distinguishable from the Blue faction pawns, from the Red faction pawns, and from the arena ground surface; no theme makes a spray or a ground mark disappear into a pawn or the backdrop. | Not run | PENDING |
| 47. Check speed and gore independence | At 1x, 2x, and 4x speed, switch gore between Off and Full and confirm the tick counter in the window title advances at the same visible rate for both settings at each speed. The gore setting never slows, pauses, or reorders simulation advancement. | Not run | PENDING |
| 48. Confirm variants resolve | Press `F9`. Every attack slot reports `READY` with a per-class breakdown, and the counts match the files in `Content/Audio/`: 10 for each of the four attack slots, 10 for `death`. A class with no take of its own shows its real count rather than a fallback-inflated one. | Not run | PENDING |
| 49. Hear the variation | Watch an unpaused battle for a full minute. Blows do not sound like one repeating sample: cuts to different parts of the body are audibly different, and the same weapon striking the same class does not always play the identical take. | Not run | PENDING |
| 50. Confirm no human voice | Listen through a full battle including many deaths. No cue contains a scream, grunt, groan, or breath. Pay particular attention to `death-02`, `death-06`, and `death-07`, whose prompt wording carries the highest risk of an accidental vocalisation. Any file that vocalises must be regenerated before release. | Not run | PENDING |
| 51. Check level consistency | No cue is obviously louder or quieter than its neighbours. The known-quiet takes — `attack-great-blade-ribcage-01`, `attack-great-blade-gut-01`, `attack-heavy-chopper-neck-01`, `death-02` — are audible under a busy battle rather than disappearing. Any that vanish need a re-roll. | Not run | PENDING |
| 52. Verify a partial set falls back | Move one hit class's takes for a single weapon out of `Content/Audio/` and relaunch. That weapon still makes a sound on a hit to that body part, drawn from the fallback class, and the sound log shows the class as missing rather than the whole slot going silent. | Not run | PENDING |

For round scoring, record Team A (Blue) and Team B (Red) totals before and after
each command together with the outgoing outcome and old/new seeds. Next Round
scores only a terminal victory and always advances the deterministic seed.
Full Reset never scores the outgoing round.

## Failure classification

Classify failures as implementation, test, environment/dependency, pre-existing,
incorrect assumption, unrelated, or flaky. Make the narrowest correction, rerun
the focused check, and expand only after it passes.
